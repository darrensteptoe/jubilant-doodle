# Defaults

Defaults exist to reduce two failure modes:
1) Users leave critical fields blank
2) Users choose implausible values because the UI doesn’t guide them

## What defaults should do
- Provide a sane starting point
- Encourage realistic ranges
- Make it obvious what must be customized per race

## Default categories
- **Race type presets** (state leg, municipal, federal, etc.)
- **Universe basis** suggestions
- **Contact and conversion assumptions**
- **Budget/capacity ceilings** for tactics

## How to use defaults safely
1. Start with a preset close to your race type.
2. Immediately override:
   - universe size (your district reality)
   - baseline vote shares
   - turnout expectations
3. Treat contact and persuasion rates as *hypotheses*:
   - update them after first week of field metrics

## When defaults are dangerous
- When you use them as “truth” instead of placeholders
- When your race has unusual turnout patterns (special elections, storms, major ballot measures)
- When messaging environment changes rapidly (scandals, breaking news)

Defaults are scaffolding, not conclusions.
